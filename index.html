        <h1 class="text-title">1. “Too much homage”</h1>
        <p class="text">
          At this point, the similarities between Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for
          a Dream (2000) and Satoshi Kon’s cult anime classic Perfect Blue
          (1997) are common knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          You’ve likely seen a few of the
          <a href="#">side-by-side comparisons</a>. They’ve circulated for
          years. Each time they reappear, there’s another small uproar — and old
          rumors pop up again, like the one where Aronofsky supposedly owned the
          rights to adapt Perfect Blue (he didn’t).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          That said, we’re not here to restate the obvious. Perfect Blue and
          Requiem for a Dream are similar, but we’re interested in the follow-up
          questions. Why? What really happened between Kon and Aronofsky? And
          when does homage stop being respectful and start being exploitative?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          We’ve chased down the answers for months — dredging up every source we
          can find, and even importing the recent French documentary Satoshi
          Kon: The Illusionist. (A <a href="#">tweet thread</a> by Richmond Lee
          of Art Eater was also a big help.) Today, we’re using what we’ve
          learned to set the record straight.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          So, let’s take a trip into the past — to the turn of the 21st century.

            the bathtub scene</span
          >
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Once upon a time, Satoshi Kon was a no-name. Just another artist
          struggling in manga during the ‘80s. Yet the talent was there, and it
          carried him. Becoming Katsuhiro Otomo’s assistant on the manga series
          Akira, Kon was able to follow Otomo into the anime industry.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Kon hopped around as an artist and writer, working on projects like
          Roujin Z (1991) and Magnetic Rose (1995). He climbed the ranks until
          he got to direct his first feature. That was Perfect Blue — a film
          that, despite glowing reviews, did little to elevate Kon in the
          business. Here’s how his colleague Masao Murayama put it:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            Let’s say that some said it was an original film, that it was very
            striking, and that it left a strong impression. We can’t say that
            the animation industry considered it a very good film […] we did not
            cover our costs.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">
          Basically, Perfect Blue flopped. Kon was, as he later described
          himself, an “unsuccessful animation director.” But his film struck a
          chord with another artist, an ocean away.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Darren Aronofsky was an anime fan — and a budding director. He’d just
          debuted his first movie, Pi (1998), which had a much lower budget than
          Perfect Blue but made much more money. So, Aronofsky was working on
          his next film. This was Requiem for a Dream, based on a book from the
          1970s by Hubert Selby Jr.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Aronofsky found Perfect Blue while writing the script. “I was blown
          away by it — it was fantastic,” he remembered in The Illusionist. “And
          it was very different than any other anime that was out there that I
          had seen.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          At that time, many live-action directors in America were taking from
          anime. It was often treated as raw material. When Terminator 2
          borrowed a moment from Akira, one of James Cameron’s artists recalled
          that Otomo’s original visual was “almost like a storyboard” for the
          team. The Wachowskis pitched The Matrix by playing their producer
          Ghost in the Shell. As he recounted:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            … they said, “We wanna do that for real.” And, you know, that was an
            incredible idea. To actually see that animation come to life. And,
            believe me, essentially it has.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">
          Aronofsky was so smitten with Perfect Blue that, at one point, he even
          tried to buy the rights to do a live-action remake. That deal never
          went through (Aronofsky has given various reasons why over the years).
          Either way, the film influenced him.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Most of the events in Requiem for a Dream derive from Selby’s book — a
          disorienting, stream-of-consciousness story about addiction and
          despair. But Aronofsky also incorporated ideas from Perfect Blue, most
          famously the scene where Jennifer Connelly’s character screams
          underwater in a bathtub. He remembers reaching out to Kon for
          permission, although we haven’t seen Kon mention this.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Kon, for his part, was shocked when he saw Requiem for a Dream. In the
          early 2000s, he <a href="#">told the readers</a> of his blog, “There
          are scenes in Requiem that were heavily influenced by Perfect and
          shots that were copied in their entirety.” He singled out the tub
          scene, but didn’t stop there. The shared motif of the red dress drew
          his attention, too.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Then, on January 18, 2001, the two directors met.</p>
        <div class="image-container" style="max-width: 600px">
          <img
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73f2884c-aa6a-4093-9b1a-1353eee37871_545x577.png"
            alt="image"
          />
          <span>
            Satoshi Kon’s storyboards for the tub scene from Perfect Blue — he
            boarded the whole film himself. When he watched Requiem for a Dream,
            he saw these images once again. “Just like in my storyboard!” he
            said.
          </span>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
          It was a conversation at a hotel, hosted by Esquire to promote Requiem
          for a Dream. They spoke through an interpreter. Kon attended partly to
          advertise his second film, Millennium Actress. He and Aronofsky
          followed it with food at a Thai restaurant.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Aronofsky was overjoyed. “I will never forget the meal I had with
          Satoshi Kon in Tokyo. He was incredibly generous and warm. For a fan,
          it was a huge thrill,” <a href="#">he later wrote</a>. He said that he
          asked Kon:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          … what he thought of the [tub] shot, and he said he was very proud.
          So, it was great. It was a lot of fun to have that kind of connection
          with him.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">
          Kon’s view of their conversation was a bit different. “When I was told
          upon meeting him that he was a fan,” he wrote on his blog, “all I
          could do was respond with the vague smile that Japanese people are
          good at.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Regarding the shot, Kon broached the subject by telling Aronofsky, “I
          was a little embarrassed to see scenes in Requiem that I had seen
          somewhere before.” Aronofsky replied that he was paying homage.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          As Kon’s former colleagues repeatedly say in The Illusionist, Kon had
          two sides. One side was endearing. Kon could be supportive and
          courteous. Aronofsky saw that part of him. Yet, at other times, Kon
          could be vicious. He burned bridges. Many of his closest co-workers,
          even those who remember him fondly, have described him with the phrase
          iyana yatsu. “Nasty guy.”1
        </p>
        <p>
          Kon revealed a bit of this side on his blog after the meal, ribbing
          Aronofsky and suggesting that Requiem had ripped off Perfect Blue. He
          wrote that Aronofsky was paying “too much homage.” But his claws
          weren’t totally out, and he treated Requiem for a Dream as mostly
          benign. Kon was much angrier when he recalled the meeting in 2007,
          during a lecture:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Satoshi Kon</b>: When I asked him about it, he said it was an
            homage. (laughs) An homage to me! To me! And who’s doing this scene
            in Requiem for a Dream? Jennifer Connelly. She’s doing this scene.
            Just like in my storyboard! (laughs) As a side note, last year I was
            on the same flight as Jennifer Connelly. She was in first class with
            her entire family; I was in business class. So she got off the plane
            first.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Runa Nagai</b>: So you didn’t get a chance to talk to her?
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <b>Satoshi Kon</b>: No, you can’t go, “Hey, Jennifer! Damn you, you
            copy-catted me.” Well, not like she was the one who did it.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text">
          In part, his feelings were understandable. Aronofsky was a star by
          this point, while Kon was scrambling for funding. Pi was a hit, and
          Perfect Blue wasn’t. That pattern played out again with Requiem for a
          Dream and Millennium Actress. Although Requiem for a Dream isn’t to
          Perfect Blue what The Matrix is to Ghost in the Shell, you can still
          feel Kon’s influence in it.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          You feel it especially in the Connelly character, whose arc later in
          the movie takes cues from Mima, the protagonist of Perfect Blue.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          It’s in the tub scene. It’s in the scene where Connelly trashes a
          room. And what happens to Connelly’s character in the final moments of
          Requiem for a Dream is a close paraphrase of, arguably, the central
          sequence in Perfect Blue — from the blinding lights to the cheering
          men around the table. Unlike most of Requiem for a Dream, for the
          record, this scene is noticeably absent from Selby’s original book.2
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          At least for the last leg of Requiem for a Dream, it’s clear that
          Aronofsky saw in Perfect Blue a source of inspiration for what to do
          with Connelly’s character. Ultimately, it’s a small slice of the film.
          But it’s still a slice.
        </p>

          Pointing out that Aronofsky took from Perfect Blue is different from
          condemning him for it, although you can do both. After all, every
          piece of art takes from somewhere. Kon was open about how much he
          learned from foreign filmmakers like Terry Gilliam. Meanwhile, Perfect
          Blue’s film-within-a-film Double Bind plays much the same role in its
          story as Invitation to Love does in Twin Peaks (a series that went big
          in Japan).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          At the same time, though, there’s an ethical question.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Until the end of his life, Kon was a struggling director. Even after
          two acclaimed films, he was so unsuccessful that Tokyo Godfathers
          almost didn’t get funded. Is it still an homage when you’re lifting
          from an immediate contemporary who’s far below you in status and
          clout? As Kon wrote in 2001, after meeting Aronofsky:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            I’m feeling pathetic. It’s a pitiful tale when the person being paid
            homage to has less name recognition, less social credibility and
            less budget to spend.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">
          Again, most of Requiem for a Dream comes from Selby’s book. Even the
          motif of the red dress and the moment when people pop out of a TV,
          which Kon perceived as plagiarism, are Selby’s ideas from the ‘70s.3
          Requiem for a Dream isn’t Perfect Blue. But it does treat its ideas as
          fair game.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Aronofsky seems to have been a fan, first and foremost. He loved
          anime, and he loved Kon’s work. The culture of swiping from anime in
          American cinema predated him. It persists now. As Rodney Rothman (Into
          the Spider-Verse) says in The Illusionist, “A lot of people in
          live-action are chasing the ‘Satoshi Kon feel,’ that level of
          immersiveness.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          That included Aronofsky himself, later in life, when he took from
          Perfect Blue again to make Black Swan. (<a href="#">He denied it</a>,
          but come on.)
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In the end, the real question we need to ask is much bigger than
          Aronofsky. It’s even bigger than Kon. The question is, “Is it right
          for Western directors to use anime as an idea factory, without paying
          its overworked creators a dime?”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Kon bled for his films. He storyboarded every moment in detail,
          obsessively, and still never saw success in his lifetime (he died in
          2010, around a week before the premiere of Black Swan). It stung him
          to see his concepts treated as the rough drafts for other people’s
          films. He battled to create those concepts, until the end.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Looking back on their meeting for his interview in The Illusionist,
          Aronofsky remembered:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            [It] was kind of inspiring to find out that he was conceiving it,
            drawing it, writing it, so many of all the different roles were
            basically coming out of his imagination and the hard work. I
            remember kind of feeling empathy for how much work he had to do.
            That it was gonna be a lot of pain, a lot of work to get his film
            done.
          </p>

          The world of Russian animation isn’t heading in a great direction.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          As we’ve <a href="#">reported</a>, the global sanctions and boycotts
          on Russia, designed to pressure Putin into ending his horrific
          invasion of Ukraine, have touched Russia’s animators. This week, the
          Russian Animated Film Association (AAKR) offered
          <a href="#">an update</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            … the current situation in the world has most painfully affected
            international relations in the field of animation and culture in
            general. We see how many of our partners from Europe and the United
            States refuse to cooperate, terminate existing agreements and block
            Russian-made children’s content. Our films are not taken to
            international festivals or are asked not to mention that they are
            from Russia.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">
          The AAKR ended with a plea to the world that “cultural cooperation has
          no and should have no borders.” As a new Iron Curtain settles around
          Russia, that view seems increasingly of the past.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The animation business in Russia is shrinking inward. Take the
          upcoming film Finnick. It just got <a href="#">signed</a> to a
          distributor owned by Gazprom — after Sony Pictures dropped its
          <a href="#">previous distribution</a> deal. As Western companies back
          out more and more, like Paramount and Disney did this week, the
          Russian animation industry will be trapped increasingly in Russia.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          And the country is leaning into this isolation. Dismissing a copyright
          lawsuit, the courts just granted an “entrepreneur” named Ivan
          Kozhevnikov <a href="#">the right to plagiarize Peppa Pig</a>. As one
          American lawyer writes, “I would expect Russia’s efforts to steal
          Western IP to intensify in the coming weeks.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Meanwhile, domestic social media platforms VK and OK are booming, as
          Russians lose access to Western-made ones and VPN services get
          <a href="#">harder and harder</a> to find. For a limited time, VK is
          <a href="#">reportedly</a> giving 100% of ad revenue back to creators
          — which includes animators who share their work on the service.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          That rush to fund artists is happening at the government level, too.
          New rules, <a href="#">rolled out this week</a>, make it easier than
          ever to get state funding. Before, studios <a href="#">needed</a> to
          put up anywhere from 50,000 to 1 million rubles as collateral to
          apply. Now, it’s free.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          At the same time, the world continues to support Ukraine directly.
          Artists are <a href="#">running</a> “free film screenings for children
          and families at refugee reception centers near the Polish-Ukrainian
          border and throughout Poland.” Streaming platforms in Germany and
          Poland are <a href="#">providing</a> free Nickelodeon shows to
          Ukrainian refugee children. And France is rolling out a
          <a href="#">new fund</a> for Ukrainian artists — and for Russian
          opponents of Putin who’ve fled their home country.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          This week, the French outlet La Croix spoke to animator Eugène
          Boitsov, a Ukrainian immigrant in Valence who’s helping refugees in
          his area. Asked about the animation world’s protests in support of
          Ukraine, he was torn. Part of him thinks they’re useless. But another
          part believes that they matter.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          “Art and animation will especially be very useful when Ukraine wins,”
          Boitsov said, “to help rebuild the country.”

          Our recent <a href="#">dive into the underrated Princess Arete</a> is
          one example. It shows how director Sunao Katabuchi rose up after
          struggling for years in the anime industry — even losing his director
          role on Kiki’s Delivery Service. The article is loaded with rare
          details, many of which haven’t appeared in English until now. It’s an
          exciting story.
